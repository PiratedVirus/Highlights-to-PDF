					A page replacement algorithm suffers from Belady's anamoly when it is not a stack algorithm. ¶ A stack algorithm is one that satisfies the inclusion property. The inclusion property states that, at a given time, the contents(pages) of a memory of size k page-frames is a subset of the contents of memory of size k+1k+1 page-frames, for the same sequence of accesses. The advantage is that running the same algorithm with more pages(i.e. larger memory) will never increase the number of page faults. ¶ Is LRU a stack algorithm? ¶ Yes, LRU is a stack algorithm.
