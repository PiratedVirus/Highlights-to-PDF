        Whatever be the situation, we are always giving priority to the older process. (we make all resource available
        to oldest process) ⇒ No Deadlock.  If a process Pi requests then there are finite number of processes which
        are older than Pi, therefore Pi is guaranteed to have a chance of executing successfully. ⇒ No Starvation.

        A page replacement algorithm suffers from Belady's anamoly when it is not a stack algorithm.  A stack
        algorithm is one that satisfies the inclusion property. The inclusion property states that, at a given time,
        the contents(pages) of a memory of size k page-frames is a subset of the contents of memory of size k+1k+1
        page-frames, for the same sequence of accesses. The advantage is that running the same algorithm with more
        pages(i.e. larger memory) will never increase the number of page faults.  Is LRU a stack algorithm?  Yes, LRU
        is a stack algorithm. Therefore, it doesn't suffer from Belady's...

        Answer is A.  MST is not unique only when edges are not distinct. Here the edges are distinct. Be careful for
        the keyword DISTINCT.  Shortest Path can be different even if the edges are distinct. Example is shown below.
        Shortest path from A to C is not unique here.

        fragmentation of the parent the MF bit of the last fragment is also set to 1 because there are fragments after

        The Floyd-Warshall all-pairs shortest path runs in O(n3) time, which is asymptotically no better than n calls
        to Dijkstra’s algorithm. However, the loops are so tight and the program so short that it runs better in
        practice. It is notable as one of the rare graph algorithms that work better on adjacency matrices than
        adjacency lists.

                we will ALWAYS have different LMD and RMD for given string, but that does not make it ambiguous. If we
                have two PARSE TREES for given string that makes it ambiguous.  Either we have 2 parse trees or  2
                LMD or  2 RMD.  In either of three cases, we say it is ambiguous.  We can always drive a string
                using 3 methods - Parse tree, LMD and RMD. But if either of this have 2 instances then it is
                ambigious.

                Swap space is the area on a hard disk which is part of the Virtual Memory of your machine, which is a
                combination of accessible physical memory (RAM) and the swap space. Swap space temporarily holds memory
                pages that are inactive. Swap space is used when your system decides that it needs physical memory for
                active processes and there is insufficient unused physical memory available. If the system happens to
                need more memory resources or space, inactive pages in physical memory are then moved to the swap space
                therefore freeing up that physical memory for other uses. Note that the access...

                we will use some part of main memory as a stack, along that we know that there is no fixed size of
                stack in real implementation but here in some questions of GATE they have been used as some 100-200

                Scheduler is like Boss who only decide which process will run next and assign the work of preemption to
                dispatcher.Dispatcher is like worker who will stop the current process do Context switch and all other
                work like saving the value of registers and all.Thus Scheduler itself never interrupt the running
                process.

                And Invalidation of TLB means resetting TLB which is necessary because A TLB entry may belong to any
                page table of any process thus resetting ensures that the entry corresponds to the process that we are
                searching for.

                Invalidation is necessary. Otherwise the new process might end up using the translation of the old
                process. Saving and reuse of TLB is not necessary but can lead to better performance.
